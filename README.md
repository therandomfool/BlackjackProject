### Blackjack Project
Project Requirement #0
You'll push your project to a Github repo named BlackjackProject. Be sure to include a README.md.

- User Story #1
Create a class structure that mimics a deck of cards. Remember decks as well as hands are made up of cards. Feel free to create the structure in any way you see fit.

Your card and deck implementations should NOT be coupled to Blackjack; you should be able to reuse them to implement a poker or bridge game application.

- User Story #2
Add methods and fields to your classes that mimic the functionality of shuffling and dealing a deck of cards. Remember that when a card is dealt you have to remove it from the current deck. You should be able to print out a shuffled deck to the terminal.

- User Story #3
Deal two hands of cards - one to a Dealer and another to a Player. Allow the players to Hit (add cards to their hand) or Stay (not add cards to their hand) in accordance to the rules of blackjack shown in the wiki.

Do not worry about the multiple values for Ace until your basic game logic is working. Assume they are 11 to start.<--------------

- User Story #4
The Dealer's decisions are based on game logic in the program.

The Dealer must decide to Hit or Stay based on the rules of Blackjack: if the Dealer's hand total is below 17, the Dealer must Hit; if the hand total is 17 or above, the Dealer must Stay.

- User Story #5
Determine the winner of each round by implementing the remaining rules of Blackjack (such as going over 21) and comparing hand values.


#### Technologies Used

- Eclipse
- Java
- Terminal Commands
- GitHub/Git
- UML
- Zoom
- GOOGLE / Stackoverflow

#### Lessons Learned
- Keep focused on MVP
- Wasn't a stated goal or stretch goal, created clear deck/create deck and reshuffle to continue playing.
- creating an UML is tougher than it looks.  I will have to make many more to get the skill.
- Getting comfortable building classes in an Object-Oriented manner.
- Building classes whose fields are Objects.
- Practice writing methods.
- Use collection types to organize and manage data.
- Use conditionals to create game logic.
